INTERPRETATION

lOMoAR cPSD| 19662931
Introduction:
Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), its assumptions, formula, and applications .
CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model):
Assumptions:
1. Perfect Capital Markets: Assumes no taxes, transaction costs, or restrictions on the flow of information, allowing for frictionless trading.
2. Homogeneous Expectations: Assumes all investors have the same expectations regarding future returns, standard deviations, and correlations.
3. Risk-Free Rate: Assumes the existence of a risk-free rate at which investors can lend or borrow money without any risk.
4. Single Holding Period: Assumes investors hold securities for a single period without intermediate consumption.
5. Investors are Price Takers: Assumes investors' buying or selling activities do not influence security prices.
Formula:
The CAPM formula is given by:
[ Ri = Rf + \beta_i (R_m - R_f) \]
Where:
- \( R_i \) is the expected return on the investment. - \( R_f \) is the risk-free rate. - \( \beta_i \) is the beta of the investment, representing its systematic risk. - \( R_m \) is the expected return of the market. - \( (R_m - R_f) \) is the market risk premium.
Applications:
1. Expected Return Estimation: Used to estimate the expected return on an investment based on its systematic risk relative to the market.
2. Cost of Capital: Determines the cost of equity for companies, aiding in project evaluation and investment decision- making.
3. Valuation: Employed in the valuation of companies by discounting future cash flows using the cost of equity derived from CAPM.
4. Portfolio Management: Helps assess the expected return and risk of a portfolio based on individual asset characteristics.
5. Risk Management: Assists in understanding and managing systematic risk associated with an investment, aiding in risk-return trade-off decisions.
